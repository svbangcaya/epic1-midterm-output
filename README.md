For the first time, I will use Python to make a simple mandala art. I remember playing with my ruler with the huge circle on itÂ when I was in  elementary school, pointing my pen on it with different colors like red, blue, green, and swirling it round and round on a piece of paper till the result will be the same as this mandala art I've created.
